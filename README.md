## Recommended Use and Version Control

There are two important parts of every Auro component. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">class</a> and the custom clement. The class is exported and then used as part of defining the Web Component. When importing this component as described in the <a href="#install">install</a> section, the class is imported and the `auro-badge` custom element is defined automatically.

To protect from versioning conflicts with other instances of the component being loaded, it is recommended to use our `registerComponent(name)` method and pass in a unique name.

```js
import './node_modules/@aurodesignsystem/auro-badge';
registerComponent('custom-badge');
```

This will create a new custom element that you can use in your HTML that will function identically to the `auro-badge` element.

<div class="exampleWrapper">
  <custom-badge type="warning">Salutations World!</custom-badge>
</div>
<auro-accordion alignRight>
  <span slot="trigger">See code</span>
  ```html
  <custom-badge type="warning">Salutations World!</custom-badge>
  ```

</auro-accordion>

## Install bundled assets from CDN

<!-- AURO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (REMOTE:url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlaskaAirlines/WC-Generator/master/componentDocs/partials/usage/bundleInstallDescription.md) -->
In cases where the project is not able to process JS assets, there are pre-processed assets available for use. See -- `auro-badge__bundled.js` for modern browsers. Legacy browsers such as IE11 are no longer supported.

**WARNING!** When installing into your application environment, DO NOT use `@latest` for the requested version. Risks include unknown MAJOR version releases and instant adoption of any new features and possible bugs without developer knowledge. The `@latest` wildcard should NEVER be used for production customer-facing applications. You have been warned.
